Before we do mapping
  We need to understand the conditions for different mobility impairments
    We should look at nacto.org / resources for guidance

Breakdown of privately owned sidewalks vs city of columbus sidewalks - how do we know?

What is the impact of us collecting and highlighting the sidewalk conditions
  - grant assistance programs to help with sidewalk repairs
  - So, once a sidewalk is constructed the owner of the property is ultimately responsible for repairs. They could receive a bill from the city...

Can we collect information in such a way that we tag, for instance, a corner / section, that is not a candidate for traversal by a wheelchair. If we collect granular data available could this cause issues?

safe routes to school
things we could help raise awareness / priority of need

aarp has a walk audit toolkit - https://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/getting-around/info-2014/aarp-walk-audit-tool-kit.html

columbus advisory committee on disability issues

Could we make the information our application collects about hazards available to openstreetmap?

app - osmamd?

How do we handle the non-technical user. What if Karen does not have an app or has issues with data entry etc. Could we do something like an Alexa voice app to enter data ( capture location etc to enrich ), a button that someone could push on their wheelchair that somehow. Some kind of embedded computer with a button, batter and specific purpose ( think arduino or esp32 etc ) with gps tracking. This just collects "something not right here" with gps coords.

areas with no sidewalks and people with wheelchairs and such

Is there an opportunity for interop with the multi-modal transportation application / use case. For instance could we work together to have data collection ( button, there is an obstacle ) and/or collect data from a community perspective which can then feed into this application for later use. EG handicap routing and route people around known issues.

What is our mission statement / objective for this project?
  Are we looking for an app to help route people around obstacles?
  

How could we leverage local community boards to farm out information gathering?

http://www.morpc.org/tool-resource/complete-streets/
  These are essentially policies by cities. What defines a complete street?

How do we prevent the data collected from going stale? Is data from 6 months ago still relevant? how complete is the data collected for a given area etc

For the data we have on sidewalks, what is the center line? If you are mapping the physical location of an identification and mapping it against morpc / other data we need a way to make sure the location attribute matches. Centerline is attached to the street. We need more clarity ;)
