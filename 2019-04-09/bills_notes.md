   - Think of the user as the hero
   - Think about how we present data, how the systems are designed / function
   - Think about how to provide the best value to our hero ;)

From SCOS platform
   Mackenzie King , Johnson Dennon ( SP? )
   4/22 - data platform 2.0 release
      4/29 is hard launch
      will be ready to take in more near real-time data
      first release to open source planned for approx June 18 2019
      Please remember to add your data / use case for existing data platform. Ping Mackenzie
      Talking about possibility of partnering with Giveback Hack
      
      questions:
            All csv / tabular data will be migrated
            June will be the non tabular data
            means of access?
               A few days before launch early access
               data preview will not be present initially, future release
            will have share links for direct access ( vs hidden in iframe )
            when will ckan interface api go away? No specific date given

      Will be reaching out re visualization and other use cases in the coming months
      Johnson and Mackenzie are both watching the scode-api channel and will be available to answer questions about api access
      Initially each csv for a dataset will become an individual dataset within the new platform. For instance a dataset in ckan  with multiple csvs will become individual datasets in the new interface. Its unknown how we will reference all tables of a given dataset / corpus / collection

Data quality, relationships and feedback
   do we track this kind of in a git repo, github issue somewhere in scodemeetup or report direct to smartcolumbusos.com feedback.
      Concern here is that we don't have a feedback loop / status from the platform
      Could we simply open an issue to track, then submit the feedback to smartcolumbusos.com with a reference to our issue
   Does this fit into some kind of knowledgebase, discussion forum etc

Bill / Product owner ( organizers? )
   Need to meet with Age friendly columbus, mmtpa application dev team and others
      If we collect this information
         what would they need information-wise ( essentially schema and how do we join with sidewalks )
         what data would we want to join this with
         where can we host this app and data in the future
         Are there 
   How can we go about data collection
      crowd sourcing is pretty much a must
      what about senior people who do not have or know how to work a cell phone
      can we text?
      Is a phone call going to be sufficient?
      see 4ALL presentation / ideas

   Application vision
      API to receive calls from some kind of client ( phone app, web page whatever )
         Format to a consistent format, store somewhere
      Client submission apps
         web app
         mobile phone ( ios, android etc )
         web app
         phone / text? how do we get location
      Reporting
         What kind of reporting to we need?
         visualize reports on a map?
         how do we age out data?
         dedupe reports within some geo distance
      Access
         The intent here is for providing valuable datasets to mapping / trip planning
         How do we make the data we collect usable to transit applications
            Should we be providing access to 3rd parties?
