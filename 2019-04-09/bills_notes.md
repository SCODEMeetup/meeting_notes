[Computer as Partner: A Synergistic Approach to Interaction Design](https://uxmag.com/articles/computer-as-partner-a-synergistic-approach-to-interaction-design)
   * Think of the user as the hero
   * Think about how we present data, how the systems are designed / function
   * Think about how to provide the best value to our hero ;)

From SCOS platform
==

Reps:
1. Mackenzie King
1. Johnson Dennon ( SP? )

Notes:
1. 4/22 - data platform 2.0 release
   * 4/29 is hard launch
1. New platform will be ready to take in more near real-time data
1. first release to open source planned for approx June 18 2019
1. Please remember to add your data / use case for existing data platform. Ping Mackenzie
1. Talking about possibility of partnering with Giveback Hack

Misc questions / answers:
1. All csv / tabular data will be migrated
   * June will be the non tabular data
   * means of access?
   * A few days before launch early access
1. data preview will not be present initially, future release
1. will have share links for direct access ( vs hidden in iframe )
1. when will ckan interface api go away? No specific date given

Mackenzie / others will be reaching out re visualization and other use cases in the coming months

Johnson and Mackenzie are both watching the scode-api channel and will be available to answer questions about api access

Initially each csv for a dataset will become an individual dataset within the new platform. For instance a dataset in ckan  with multiple csvs will become individual datasets in the new interface. Its unknown how we will reference all tables of a given dataset / corpus / collection

Data quality, relationships and feedback
==

* do we track this kind of in a git repo, github issue somewhere in scodemeetup or report direct to smartcolumbusos.com feedback.
* Concern here is that we don't have a feedback loop / status from the platform
* Could we simply open an issue to track, then submit the feedback to smartcolumbusos.com with a reference to our issue
* Does this fit into some kind of knowledgebase, discussion forum etc

Project rough outline based on conversations
==

1. Bill / Product owner ( organizers? )
   * Need to meet with Age friendly columbus, mmtpa application dev team and others
   * If we collect this information
   * what would they need information-wise ( essentially schema and how do we join with sidewalks )
   * what data would we want to join this with
   * where can we host this app and data in the future
1. How can we go about data collection
   * crowd sourcing is pretty much a must
   * what about senior people who do not have or know how to work a cell phone
   * can we text?
   * Is a phone call going to be sufficient?
   * see 4ALL presentation / ideas
1. Application vision
   * API to receive calls from some kind of client ( phone app, web page whatever )
      * Format to a consistent format, store somewhere
   * Client submission apps
      * web app
      * mobile phone ( ios, android etc )
   * web app
      * phone / text? how do we get location
1. Reporting
   * What kind of reporting to we need?
   * visualize reports on a map?
   * how do we age out data?
   * dedupe reports within some geo distance
1. Access
   * The intent here is for providing valuable datasets to mapping / trip planning
   * How do we make the data we collect usable to transit applications
      * Should we be providing access to 3rd parties?
