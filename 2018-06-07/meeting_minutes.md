# Retrospective Discussion
1. Making discovery process of the relevant data more user friendly!
    1. Take user inputs and suggest datasets based on those inputs.
        1. Create may be a form to get information on what kind of problem you are solving, and suggest datasets that will be more relevant.
    2. Use visualization to describe data sets
        1. visualize some sample data to give an example
        2. suggests what kinds of causes / problems it will be useful for
    3. Add information about where the data (source) is coming from? How ofter its updated.
    4. Rules for Data ingestion
        1. before adding data in SCOS ensure some rules are followed. 
            1. e.g Source info, how often its updated, reliability, data dictionary etc
    5. Add Amazon style recommendations
        1. When searching datasets system can recommend what other related datasets people people looked when they search the same term.
    6. Let community contribute about information on the data
        1. Run a wiki style page, where people can contribute how they have used this data before, what are the strengths and weeknesses of the dataset. 
2. Acceptance guidance for new datasets
3. Pre-event attendee sign in. Could enter tech stack or background in profile. Would help team selection process.
    1. Hackathon organization

# Ben Blanquera's advise on Use cases
1. Find/think of a uses case that you are passionate about. 
2. Can you create a solution? validate.
3. Build the solution
4. Test it
5. Promote to SCOS production instance

# Mid Ohio food bank data updates
1. Some data is already being added in the SCOS data sets
2. Other rich set of data will be loaded in upcoming weeks/months. 

# Benefits of putting your project into SCOS
1. Convenience and easy to deploy
2. Provide a platform to deploy the apps, so no hosting overhead
3. Become part of community contributed projects that can be seamlessly shared / exposed to be used by others teams to build on top of that work.
4. Resilient and secure environment

# Ideas to run meetup
1. Build teams with the intention to build and deploy projects
    1. Form team, find individual strengths within your team
    2. Getting the team mindset
2. First 30 mins- What each group did in the past month. 1 hour team break out. Last 30 mins you are doing before next time.
3. Data owner lightning talks
    1. Data champions to be able to attend
4. Cross teams collaboration on expertise
5. Smart Columbus SCOS representatives to attend the meetup.
    1. Invite data experts
    2. People who can provide update on the vision / goals / progress of the operating system.
    3. Share Personas and use cases
6. Separate Slack for SCODE, so we can create channels for teams/use cases.

# Action items
1. Share presentations of hackathon teams. May be add them in SCODE github  (Jay / Vj to help)
2. Assist with formation of teams  (Bill / Vj to work on)
    1. Information of participants and what skillsets they offer
